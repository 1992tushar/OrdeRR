Maintenance — scoped, destructive data reset.

Used by the token-gated admin reset endpoint to clear transactional + analytics
data on a fresh-start, while PRESERVING the master/people data (customers,
salespersons, staff). Uses an EXPLICIT clear-list (never an exclude-list) so the
preserved tables can never be hit by accident.

Table names are a hardcoded allowlist — no user input reaches the SQL.
