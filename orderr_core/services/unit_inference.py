app/services/unit_inference.py

Smart unit inference for bare-number order quantities.

Implements FRD §4 (decision logic) and §5.3 (stats write path).

Hot-path contract (FRD §6 PERF-1):
  infer_unit() performs AT MOST one indexed DB read per call.
  It never scans order history.

Write-path contract (FRD §5.3):
  record_confirmed_qty() is called ONLY for confirmed quantities
  (explicit unit, or already confidently auto-resolved).
  Quantities still pending manual review must NOT update stats.
