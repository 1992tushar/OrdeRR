"""
invoice_generator.py — core billing logic for Orderr Billing.

Hold conditions (neither writes nor raises partial state):
  1. Any OrderItemActual for the order has confidence='needs_review'
     AND confirmed_by IS NULL  →  unverified physical quantity.
  2. Any product for the order appears in rate_unclear_queue with
     resolved_at IS NULL for the relevant business_date  →  rate not confirmed.

Invoice number: FLUFFY-YYYYMMDD-NNN (NNN resets to 001 each calendar day).
Sequence is derived inside the same transaction via MAX() + parse + increment.
Works identically on SQLite (local) and Postgres (prod) — no dialect-specific
sequence objects used.

rate_used is SNAPSHOTTED at generation time. Never recalculated retroactively.
amount = actual_quantity × rate_used  (full Decimal precision, no rounding).

    Rebuild an EXISTING invoice in place from the order's current (corrected)
    actuals — same invoice_number, same order_id — so a data-entry error (e.g. a
    delivered-quantity typo like 405 kg instead of 4.05 kg) can be fixed without
    minting a new invoice number or a duplicate in downstream systems (Vasy).

    refresh_rates=False (default — the quantity-correction path):
        Only quantities/amounts/total change. rate_used stays the ORIGINAL
        snapshot per product (per §rate rules, rates are never recalculated
        retroactively) — we reuse the rate from the existing invoice line for
        that product. A product newly present on the order (not on the original
        invoice) resolves its rate fresh via get_rate.

    refresh_rates=True (the rate-correction path):
        EVERY line re-resolves its rate via get_rate (customer override first,
        then today's/carried-forward daily rate). This is the ONLY way to push a
        just-changed rate into an already-issued bill, since rates are otherwise
        frozen at generation time. The invoice_number / order_id are still
        untouched, so no new number is minted and nothing duplicates downstream —
        but the matching Vasy voucher must be corrected by hand.
