"""
monthly_overheads — manually-entered accrual overheads that Vasy's expense
register never sees. Two heads today: **Salaries** and **Daily saving** (the
daily-collection amount the owner sets aside); the `head` field leaves room for
more later.

The Business "Net" (Sales − Purchases − Expenses) understated profit because
these are paid outside the Vasy ledger. Each row is one month's figure for one
head; business_overview() sums the rows whose `period` (always the 1st of the
month) falls in the viewed window and folds them into money-out / Net.

These are treated as accrual P&L lines here, so they belong in Net — unlike
loans / owner cash-in which are cash-only and live in the Cash Book.
